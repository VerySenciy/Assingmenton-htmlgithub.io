<p><strong>Some Real-Life Examples with Activities</strong><br/>
 <strong>1. Managing Time</strong><br/>
 When we get up in the morning, we see the time of waking to verify whether we have enough time to complete various tasks. (Awareness of time, reading a clock/watch, planning oneâ€™s routine)<br/>

Task: Encourage the kids to make a daily timetable for their daily activities allocating time for their hobbies, academics, leisure, sports, etc.<br/>
</p>
 <p>
<strong>2. Budgeting</strong><br/>
How much is this shirt or blouse going to cost once the 50% sale is applied? What about once the taxes are added? Do you prefer to gather your things and hope for a great deal on the cash counter? Or know the price before heading there.<br/>

That takes math knowledge and at least a basic understanding of how percentages work.<br/>
