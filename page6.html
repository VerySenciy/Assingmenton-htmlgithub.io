How many rolls of wallpaper do we need for this wall? What’s the difference between a meter and a square meter? Do we have enough space to fit in your favorite couch? Common questions when you are trying to set up your new space or apartment. It's very important to know these basics before you head to a store, otherwise, you will end up coming back empty-handed as the sales representative won’t be able to help you without the proper input from your side.<br/>

You should have a fair knowledge of dimensions and units and unit conversions to be able to sail through. It seems fairly simple if you know how to do the math.<br/>

Task: Help the kids to measure their study table.<br/>

From taking measurements, estimating the quantity and quality of clothes, choosing the color theme, estimating the cost and profit, to produce cloth according to the needs and tastes of the customers, math is followed at every stage.<br/>

Task: Join the cut pieces of waste cloth and make a small table cover.<br/>
